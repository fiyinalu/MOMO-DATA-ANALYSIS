# MOMO DATA ANALYSIS üì±

## Overview

This project is a simple SMS parsing tool written in Python that extracts SMS messages from an XML file (typically exported from Android phones using apps like SMS Backup & Restore) and converts them into a structured CSV file.

It is part of an academic assignment to demonstrate basic file parsing, data transformation, and export to a user-friendly format.
